Personal Site
===

This is my new and improved personal website. 

It's built in angular and is not currently online but will be soon.

### Building

1) `npm install`
2) `npm install -g gulp`
3) `bower install`
4) `gulp`

### Troubleshooting

When making changes sometimes the gulp server messes up with not deleing old files. 
Stop the server and run gulp clean and gulp. `gulp clean && gulp`
