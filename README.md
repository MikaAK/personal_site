Personal Site
===

This is my new and improved personal website.

It's built in angular and is not currently online but will be soon.

### Building

- `npm install`
- `npm install -g gulp`
- `bower install`
- `gulp`

### Troubleshooting

When making changes sometimes the gulp server messes up with not deleing old files.
Stop the server and run gulp clean and gulp. `gulp clean && gulp`
